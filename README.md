# PortfolioManager

This package is used to make balanced investments. Given a portfolio's target asset 
allocation and a sum of cash, the program will ouput how much cash should be invested 
in each asset such that the resulting asset allocation is as close to the target asset 
allocation as possible without selling any assets (to avoid taxable events).

## Execution
`python -m portfolio_manager.main`
